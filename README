If you've been struggling with how to structure your titanium app,
or you've been driving yourself crazy with a crap-ton of code in a giant app,

This is based on a module pattern that the Titanium folk recommend, but I've
added some special sauce by creating a sort of interface between the Titanium UI
element (in this case its a Window), and the instances of the Window class.
